For Users
========

1. Install the chrome extension

    1a. This can be done, as of the time of writing, by going to
the url “chrome://extensions” and dragging a cloned version of this repository onto the
page. Enable the extension if its not enabled.

    1b. An alternative would be to install the extension through the [webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/learning-a-second-languag/hbellpimdlanffbgemakfohcbaepogoh). The latest version can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordnewsdemo/lnimeflooanadlbhohbmgigggmepebfc)

2. Configure settings. Turn on the extension by toggling the setting "Translate:".

    On installing the extension, a logo will appear at the top-right corner of the browser, beside the address bar. By clicking on
    it, a list of settings will appear. To use the extension, the extensions must be turned on, with a
    non-zero number of words to translate, and the website to use the extension on must be enabled.
