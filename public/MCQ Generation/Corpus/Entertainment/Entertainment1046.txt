 (CNN)These princess rap battles are dope.
YouTube star Whitney Avalon scored "Buffy" star Sarah Michelle Gellar to portray Cinderella opposite her Belle from "Beauty and the Beast" in a "Princess Rap Battle" video. 
Who knew that Gellar could spit lyrics like "You followed in my footsteps, without me there's no you/Disney built an empire on these tiny glass shoes."
Avalon has released a few other videos, including Snow White vs. Elsa from "Frozen." But the one featuring Gellar is perfect timing: Walt Disney Pictures released its live-action "Cinderella" film, starring Lily James and Cate Blanchett, on Friday.
