 (CNN)Can't see Harry Potter's  Albus Dumbledore as gay? Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has a terse message for you. 
.@anakocovic21 Maybe because gay people just look like... people?
Rowling revealed that the Hogwarts School headmaster was gay after "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the final book in the boy wizard series, was released in 2007. 
Fan Ana Kocovic started the exchange by asking the author, "I wonder why you said that Dumbledore is gay because I can't see him in that way."
"Maybe because gay people just look like ... people?" Rowling wrote in her March 24 reply. 
Rowling's fans loved it. 
@jk_rowling @anakocovic21 preach! ðŸ™Œ
Rowling's response has been retweeted more than 7,000 times and favorited more than 10,000 times. 
Kocovic's original tweet has been deleted, but it seems she got the message and even enjoyed the exchange. 
@jk_rowling amazing answer... Yes you are absolutely right. Such an inspiration!!!
For other fans, Dumbledore's orientation was news. 
@jk_rowling @anakocovic21 Wait Dumbledore is gay? Now things make sense. I always wondered why he wasn't married, no kids, etc.
In the movies, the role of Albus Dumbledore has been played by two respected actors: Michael Gambon took over the role after Richard Harris died in 2002. 
Some articles and headlines interpreted Rowling's Twitter response as a "scathing" putdown of a narrow-minded fan. But in a followup tweet Wednesday, Rowling said Kocovic's query was not offensive.
A minority of people are rushing to judgement without the facts, so here they are: @anakocovic21 did NOT ask an offensive question!
My reply to her question was gentle and her response was very sweet. Read the full conversation here: http://t.co/GYXXWSPfwn
