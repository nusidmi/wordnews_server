 (CNN)Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson had a way better weekend than you.
The actor hosted "Saturday Night Live" and rocked out in some memorable sketches, including a live-action "Bambi" remake with some of the "SNL" cast portraying actors from the "Fast and Furious" franchise.
"Whan I was a boy, they took away my mother," Johnson said in character as a muscle-bound, gun-wielding Bambi. "And now it's time for them to pay ... dearly."
He also transformed, Hulk-style, into "The Rock Obama" in a sketch in which President Obama is angered by some members of Congress.
The former professional wrestler spoofed the WWE in a promo on "SNL."
But that was just a warmup to the actual Wrestlemania 31 on Sunday, when the Rock thrilled fans with a surprise appearance with UFC champion Ronda Rousey to take on WWE executives Stephanie McMahon and Triple H.
STEPH: "Get the Hell out of my ring!" 
RONDA: "Any ring I step into is MINE!"
