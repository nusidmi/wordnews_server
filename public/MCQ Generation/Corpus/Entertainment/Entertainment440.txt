 (CNN)If you're looking for damn fine coffee (and hot!), the producers of the upcoming "Twin Peaks" reboot have just what you're looking for.
Fans of the cult 1990 ABC series can breathe easier knowing that Kyle MacLachlan will return as FBI Agent Dale Cooper.
The quirky agent investigated the mysterious death of Laura Palmer, captivating viewers when it originally aired over two seasons.
MacLachlan made a surprise appearance at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour on Monday, as part of Showtime's presentation.
Viewers who like bizarre mysteries, and well, coffee-obsessed detectives, will have to wait until 2016 to get their "Twin Peaks" fix.
