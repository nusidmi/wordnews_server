This should be very interesting!
I love Gwen Stefani on The Voice but also really excited to see the comeback of Christina Aguilera. Next season will have a boatload of interesting conversations and fights between Adam and Xtina :D
Christina Aguilera is one of the most desirable trainers you could want in developing your singing skills. She is music, some say.
It is my opinion that her coming back of course made her fans happy. But will probably bring her problems in the future with her fans. Since everyone was so angry with her before.
I believe that her coming back is a bad decision because fans were mad at her when she left and will still be mad. Even though I love her and I love her music I still think this is a bad decision.

Christina Aguilera was one of the best presences the show got in its history. Great face, great voice, great coach. Looking forward to her rolling the voices.
