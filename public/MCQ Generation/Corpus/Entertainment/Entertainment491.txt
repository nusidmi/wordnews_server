Singer Shakira has listed her Miami, Florida, home once again -- this time, for $13 million, Zillow reports. After putting it up for rent last year, then putting it on the market (for $14.95 million) and promptly taking it off, the expectant mother is favoring a quieter approach to this sale: Her agent is showing the property privately to select interested buyers.
The 8,355-square-foot home has six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, an updated kitchen and light-colored hardwood floors. According to Zillow, the whole house is very peaceful and faces west with across-the-bay views of the city.
The property comes with a water-facing pool and dock access. For extra privacy, it has a gated driveway and is fenced in with hedges.
