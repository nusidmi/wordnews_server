On Monday, Chris Rock dropped by the Today show for an interview with Matt Lauer.
During the appearance, Rock made light of the show's sagging ratings, the Ray Rice scandal and GMA host Robin Roberts' cancer.
Lauer said: "This is one of those times I should have gone to the commercial about thirty seconds ago. Too late! My bad!"
Here are some other times the comedian made things uncomfortable for a host and/or audience.
