(CNN) -- Soup that is rumored to be radioactive; fish in formaldehyde; 10 people sharing a single silk hat. It could only be Frieze London, one of the world's leading contemporary art fairs.
Frieze opens its doors for the 12th year this week, with 162 galleries from 25 countries rubbing shoulders under a massive new tent designed by Universal Design Studio.
Inspired by the art, and encouraged by the promise of free champagne -- the soup not so much -- I head down to join the fun.
