Billionaire investor George Soros is a man whose gambles have usually paid off. 
He became known worldwide as "the man who broke the Bank of England" for making a $1bn bet against the pound in the early 1990s. 
Mr Soros believes the EU has its priorities wrong and should be focusing on what's going on in Ukraine.
He also says the chances of Greece leaving the euro area are now 50/50 and the country could go "down the drain".
Mr Soros - now in his 80s - was talking to the BBC's Simon Jack.
