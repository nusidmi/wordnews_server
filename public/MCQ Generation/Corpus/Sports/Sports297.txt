(CNN) -- Women 1-0 Men?
If sponsorship of professional women's sport has traditionally lagged behind its male equivalent, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) fired a shot across the gender divide Tuesday by announcing a $525 million 10-year media deal.
Describing the deal as "groundbreaking," the WTA's agreement with media organization PERFORM seeks to win greater exposure for the women's game.
"This is a game-changing and historic moment for our fans and for women's sport," WTA Chairman & CEO Stacey Allaster said in a statement.

"Our new broadcast strategy to produce all 2000 main draw singles matches in partnership with PERFORM will deliver exponential global exposure for our players, tournaments and partners."
Allaster told the New York Times the deal was the "largest in women's sports history" and more than "doubles the $21 million the WTA currently receives."
As part of the agreement, the WTA and PERFORM will set up a joint venture -- WTA Media -- which will deliver the content across television, the internet, mobile as well as social media.
"We are strong believers in the exceptional sport entertainment value of the WTA and are committed to driving the value for all WTA members and partners," said PERFORM's Joint-CEO, Simon Denyer.
