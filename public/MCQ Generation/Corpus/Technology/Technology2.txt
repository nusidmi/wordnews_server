Tomorrow Transformed explores innovative approaches and opportunities available in business and society through technology.
 (CNN)Google has announced it will stop producing Google Glass in its present form. 
In a statement posted to its Google + account, the company said it would still be working on smart glasses, but that January 19 would be the last day to get the current Glass Explorer Edition. 
The statement explained that Google Glass will "graduate" from the Google X incubator and become its own division, which will report to Nest founder Tony Fadell. 
Glass has been on sale since 2013 in the United States and allows the user to send messages, navigate and record video using voice commands. But since its launch, Glass has come up against safety and privacy issues. 
Inevitably, the announcement caused a stir on social media. 
Some agreed it was time for a revamp. 
Finally, @Google realized Glass needed a makeover (and a do-over). Now they just need a real designer. http://t.co/KTySl8EQwi
@Google's Glass decision is no surprise--it was for "explorers." And it doesn't alter the need for banks to plot #wearables strategies.
Others saw it as a positive development for Glass ...
#GoogleGlass isn't dead. Now a proper @google division. Big Emphasis on the enterprise. Great news for @pristineio @kylesamani @googleglass
... or simply admired Google's creativity
We had our laughs about Google Glass but we should be grateful they dare to do things that radical and encourage them to continue.
Many had their own views on why production had been stopped. 
You don't have to search hard to figure out why #GoogleGlass is being retooled: http://t.co/jYvryH9rXo pic.twitter.com/A712HCuic3

Others were indifferent.
Google finally put Glass 1.0 out of its misery http://t.co/N4bGFoH4af
 
I don't need Google Glass. I'm married, so I alreadyÂ have someone in my peripheral vision giving me updates and telling me what to do next.
Some reactions were surprisingly philosophical.

Those people predicting success for Google Glass were guilty of putting tech worship above human insight.
Others were surprisingly colorful.
 Google have announced that they will stop selling the #GoogleGlass next week, will we see it come back or is dead to us now? If they were more affordable would you have got one? Let me know what you think their problems where. #Google #technology #tech #art #painting #gadget #future

But whatever the response, it's unlikely that this is the end of Google Glass. Nick Thompson, editor of the New Yorker.com, told CNN that Glass may well be back in a year or so, revamped and redesigned. And he is confident that Fadell is the right man for the job.
Google puts its best designer in charge of Google Glass, its biggest design problem. http://t.co/yhpzu6sFMH
