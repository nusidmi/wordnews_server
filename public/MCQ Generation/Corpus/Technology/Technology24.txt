 (CNN)You may want to plan a BBC binge-watching party.
According to What's on Netflix Now, the streaming service may be losing favorites like "Doctor Who" and "Luther" come January 31 because of an expiring contract between the streaming service and BBC. 
That would mean missing shows like "Little Britain" and the original "House of Cards." Of course, the "Doctor Who" fans have already launched a petition to "save the show" on Netflix.
