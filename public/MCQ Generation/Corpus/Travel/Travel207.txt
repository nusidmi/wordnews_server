(CNN) -- Plans are underway to build the world's tallest -- and quite possibly most terrifying -- roller coaster at an Orlando, Florida, theme park due to open in 2017.
Suitably called "The Skyscraper," the coaster track spirals up and down the side of a 535-foot-tall observation tower.
Judging by the looks of a simulation video (below) released by the developer, it's going to be one scary ride.
"The unique design of the coaster means more incredible, heart-pounding inside and outside loops, dives, spirals and inversions in a vertical area than riders have ever before experienced," says Bill Kitchen, founder of Orlando-based US Thrill Rides, which designed the Skyscraper.
The design is based on US Thrill Rides' Polercoasters concept, in which high thrills are delivered in a small diameter footprint.
Vintage theme parks have nostalgic appeal
The coasters are boarded at the bottom of the tower, then make their way to the top before gravity takes over, with riders disembarking at the bottom.
The Skyscraper will be part of a $250 million entertainment complex planned for Orlando's International Drive called Skyplex, which includes an indoor theme park.
The developers unveiled the animated simulation of the Skyscraper at this week's International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions Expo 2014.
Graphic renderings of the roller coaster can be found in the gallery above.
So what's the current highest roller coaster in the world?
Kingda Ka, located at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey.
That one features a U-shaped track that shoots 456 feet into the sky and rockets riders from 0 to 128 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds.
