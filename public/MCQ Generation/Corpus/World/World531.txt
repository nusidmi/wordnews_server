 (CNN)A senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Syria over the weekend, Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency reported.

The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the strike. 
The son of a late Hezbollah commander was also killed in the airstrike, Hezbollah said.
Jihad Mughniyeh, the son of Imad Mughniyeh, was born in 1989. His father was assassinated in Syria in 2008.
